#### Hello, I'm Dylan. I'm a computer science graduate who loves technology! In my spare time, I've been learning to program apps with Glade. I also like to download open source AI LLMs for a private offline AI. Gaming is another passion of mine. In the future I want to start developing my own 3D games. I used to make a decent amount of games in community college using Unity, and I definitly want to make some more, but using Godot instead.

## 👀About Current Project:
### 🖐🏼 Binary Hand Counter
#### Did you know you could count to 1023 using just your fingers?! It's true! This app teaches you how to do just that by learning to count on your fingers in binary. I’m currently developing a GTK-based app in Glade that turns learning to count with binary, into a fun game. The program Will give you a number between 0-1023, and you have to specify which fingers need to be raised to represent the random number in binary. I also decided to add a bunch of pictures I drew in Krita to make things a bit more fun. I will be posting the project to github soon, and I may be packaging it into a flatpak to make it easy to download for most Linux users.
### Stuff I wanna add: 
- Difficulty Selector
- Rework the gameover screens
